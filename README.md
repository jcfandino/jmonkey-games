# jmonkey-games
Simple games or incomplete experiments made with jmonkeyengine

Most of the code is Scala and it's built using maven.
These are simple games I made for fun and I wont commercialize, or unfinished projects that I wont continue developing.
Feel free to use any code for your own projects if suited.
Hoewever assets have different CC licenses, please ask (open a bug) before using them, I would need to track the source in case I didn't authored them.
